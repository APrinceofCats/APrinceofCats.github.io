This essay will compare and contrast the common-sense assumptions about the victims of violent crime as “‘weak, passive, damaged and voiceless’ with those approaches that focus upon and prioritise the ‘lived experiences’ of victims and ‘survivors of violent crime’” (Downes, 2019, p. 209).

Perhaps the starkest difference between these two views of the world is their tendency to take either an individualist or collectivist view of the people they seek to help. Within the Criminal Justice System you tend to see individuals being offered collective solutions, whereas within victim advocacy organisations you tend to see collectives being offered individualist solutions.

As an example of the former the Police and court systems can fall victim to the systematic flaws of individual blame and harm believing that violent crime exclusively happens between one victim and one perpetrator. This then leads into the issue of people being offered one size fits all solutions, usually funnelling people through the court system with hopes of a long custodial sentence for the accused,under the assumption that every person affected by violence will feel justice has been served.

As an example of the latter individuals can be encouraged to sit down and open a dialogue with people who have harmed them or people they have done harm to, attempting to encourage one on one discussion to establish appropriate consequences and reparations but also to attempt to heal and restore relationships within affected communities.

These projects tend to work with people from demographics who disproportionately experience violence. It was explained by the Common Justice restorative justice program in New York that '70% of violent crime victims at Common Justice have been [Black, Asian, Minority Ethnic] men'  (Downes, 2019, p. 209).

Another difference is how people are characterised as responding to potentially dangerous situations within the “Fight, Flight, Freeze” model of behaviour. Many representations of victims in organisational media display them as cowering from a threat. However in depositions from people who feel vulnerable in public they almost describe themselves as engaging in a battle of wits with the people around them.

The game theory of these situations has been described as ‘Survival Maths’ by writer Damien Barr. "count the people around you, then multiply the risk based on the number of straight men/ football shirts/ drunks, then consider how fast you can run" (Downes, 2019, p. 222)

A difference between these two constructions is that constructions that present victims as ‘weak, passive, damaged and voiceless’ are often perceived as being formed from an outsider's perspective whereas constructions based off of lived experience are by necessity reliant on an insiders perspective.

A similarity between the two approaches is the assertion that vulnerable people have the ability to preempt and plan around harmful actions and disengage from abusive power structures. All crime requires forcibly taking control from someone.

In an example of the power imbalance between the state and its citizens, people from demographics who are disproportionatley affected by traffic stops describe how they navigate interactions with the police to try and maintain their safety.

“I ask questions which let the officers know that I'm not going to be the easy victim. Or so they know that I'm not going to give them a reason to overreact … They walk around with guns and sticks. So they are already in a position of power because I don't carry a gun or a stick.” (Downes, 2019, p. 224)

Another example of people potentially suffering from abusive power structures is a series of posters produced by North Yorkshire Police in 2018 asking the viewer “Which choice will you make? Happy face or abusers' place?” (Downes, 2019, p. 213)

A similarity and potential flaw shared between both views is how the data supporting them is gathered. Although the Criminal Justice System tends to make assertions based on quantitative data while community lead approaches tend to rely on qualitative data both of these rely on individuals feeling comfortable enough to share their experiences, and being able to identify harm they have suffered as a crime. This can lead to people who are comfortable with talking to a civilian agency but not the police, or the other way around, leaving the two groups with seemingly incongruent data.

In conclusion both of these constructions are perpetuated by groups and systems of thinking that believe they have the best interests of victims at heart and this exercise offers an opportunity to critically examine how different groups within society with different interests can form conflicting views of complex issues and helps to criticise taken for granted assumptions about how the world, the criminal justice system and the people in it work.
