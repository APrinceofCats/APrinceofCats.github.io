<u><h1 align = "center">Define two examples of non-criminal corporate harm in your own words.- 29/11/21</h1></u>

  <div class="article">
In this essay I will attempt to illustrate Corporate harms which are not necessarily classed as criminal by outlining two examples. Corporate harm is what happens when corporations commit harmful actions. What constitutes “harm” is a highly contested concept analysing actions and patterns that go on both behind the scenes and right under our noses in daily life.

Firstly I will outline a harm that has seen considerable coverage in the media lately (late 2021). Lobbying is the process by which organisations such as corporations, religious institutions or labour unions attempt to persuade authority figures, usually elected officials, to make decisions that give them

What constitutes “lobbying” or “sleaze” or “corruption” is highly contested, mostly by the people being accused of them. Some people view voting as a form of lobbying, or that there is no such thing as bad lobbying, only bad intentions behind it.

Except for a certain amount of zeitgeist, narratives about crime have to originate from somewhere. “They are influenced by powerful groups and social forces when making these decisions. Pressure from citizens helps drive change in a state’s laws, but so too can the lobbying of big companies, religious institutions or other countries.” (Gilmour, A., Rowe, A. and Wall, R. (2021))

It’s entirely possible for civilians and public organisations to Lobby (such as Wayne Wheeler preceding the Prohibition) It is important people understand the social systems that influence their lives and how those systems are influenced. The institution of Lobbying helps to highlight the difference between Hard versus Soft power. An example of Hard power would be someone being elected to Parliament, whereas Soft power would be demonstrated in someone having the money to launch an ad campaign targeted to try and persuade those elected. You must convince those in power that listening to you would be worth their while.

Secondly I’ll investigate the example perhaps most prevalent through society- Advertising. Alongside the assertion by the “Brandalism” artist group that “Advertising shits in your head” (It seems they are skipping straight to the ‘Claims’ part of the investigation process).Perhaps a good question to start with would be 'How does advertising affect people?' and a claim of 'If advertising didn't increase people’s desire to spend money, companies would stop doing it'.

The Evidence for this view can be hard to pin down, given how intertwined with daily life advertising can be. However there are some clear examples.

Perhaps the clearest form of advertising is having a celebrity pop onto screen holding a product and explain why they think it’s worth the asking price, although this social contract between brands and consumers of “ads during the ad breaks” has increasingly broken down in favour of more subliminal messaging. Many pieces of advertising, overt and covert, exploit the phenomena of parasocial relationships to have us give the same consideration to their endorsement as we would to the recommendation of a friend. I eat at the Golden Gate Chinese restaurant because my Grandparents do, I use a Faber-Castell pencil because Hannibal Lecter does.

Some potentially unhealthy products and services have a history of supporting sporting events, most notably Coke Cola sponsoring the Olympics and various gambling services, to attempt to make people mentally equate them with a healthy lifestyle. It could be said that not all these actions are equally harmful as there are people who enjoy these products and pastimes in moderation, raising the question of if the advertisers have a responsibility to protect their customers versus the customer's own personal responsibility. Advertising in Britain is moderated under a system of self regulation to be “legal, decent, truthful, and honest” (The Open University, 2021). “What will the public allow us to get away with?”

The bottom line of understanding this issue requires understanding how corporations, or any organisation with a message to communicate, behave. We must also come to terms with the fact that, while we can train ourselves to recognise propaganda, none of us are immune to it. We must work to provide people with the most accurate, truthful information possible and have faith that they can use their imaginations to form brilliant new ideas.

There is a fair amount of opinion involved at the start of the process, a sort of survivorship bias, it’s easier for someone to think to ask if an action is potentially harmful if it would be potentially harmful to them. This is why, when analysing for myself, rather than the process of “Questions, Claims, Evidence, Understanding” I describe the final step as Comprehension. You can learn the history of an issue, you can theorise how it affects people and how a new development affects it, but you can never truly understand it.
