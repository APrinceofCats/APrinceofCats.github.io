<p style="font-size:19px">What is the Leisure Centre actually for? It has the pool you can ogle with the floor to ceiling windows facing the street, I think that helped them decide where the over-60&#39;s class would be held, not that I&#39;m complaining.</p>

<p>Soon it&#39;ll all be one big orgy, businesses and prospective workers from miles around dolling themselves up, hitting the town, and sizing up the freshest cuts of meat on the block. I wonder who&#39;s whoring themselves out more, us or them?</p>

<p>So I trimmed my beard, upstairs and downstairs, borrowed a pair of knee pads and got ready to do my due diligence as an up and coming journalistic intern.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll probably get people questioning the ethics of covering this while not wearing a press pass, well:-</p>

<p>
  <ol type = "a">
  <li>You need credentials to get a press pass, and if I had those I wouldn&#39;t be at a job fare</li>
  <li>I told most of them, that I both wanted to be a journalist and was explicitly there for journalism</li>
  <li>All of this information was publicly available, and normally that means it&#39;s in the bottom of a locked filing cabinet in a disused bathroom.</li>
