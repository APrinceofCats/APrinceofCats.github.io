Working with people towards mental health goals was never my strong suit. It was somewhat comforting to realise that a lot of people had the same insecurities in phoning a helpline as me, mostly that there was some theoretical ‘Other’ more deserving of their time than me. I would sit holding the phone with the number dialled in wondering who was already talking to them, what they were talking about, who would be waiting in line behind me. It was a horror story essentially, no tragedy I knew I was suffering through could possibly be as bad as the one I imagined for someone else.

So I did the next best thing for my imagined comrades in mental illness and began gathering the materials for a parasocial relationship. I thought that if I learned everything there was to know about these institutions I could predict how they would act and react, that being able to assign names and faces to these mystical orders would make them less imposing. I was almost hoping I could find a script they had to follow when they first picked up the phone.
