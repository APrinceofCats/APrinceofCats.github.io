  <div class="article">
<p>I felt my old system of tagging articles was inefficient, so I revamped them. The old system looked like this-</p>
<br>
    <div class="tags-container">
      <div>Tag</div>
      <div>Purpose</div>
      <div>Articles Tagging</div>

      <div>Recent</div>      
      <div>All posts presented in cronological order</div>
      <div>9</div>
      
      <div>Pre-2024</div>      
      <div>I took a break from writing and wanted to show before and after</div>

      <div>History</div>      
      <div>The lore of organisations and how they grew into their modern forms</div>
      <div>1</div>
      
      <div>Law</div>      
      <div>Events that were influenced by UK and Welsh law</div>
      <div>1</div>
      
    </div><!--Table-->

    I deleted pre-2024 because the tags would balloon as I added a new one every year.
<br><br>
I deleted Coping and History because they're overall themes in my work, if I want to talk about  History I can say so in the article title.
<br><br>
I consolidated Local News and Social into Community because both were covering community organising.
<br><br>
I renamed Law into Politics, because I want to track political changes through the system, not just once they become laws.
<br><br>
I'll add more tags as my experience grows, but for now this collections feels sufficient.
