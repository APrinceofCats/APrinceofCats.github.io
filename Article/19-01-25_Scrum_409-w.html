    Projects breed projects. My laptop shell’s cracked, I should replace it. But I might bugger up the screen, I should set up its SSH. But my desktop runs Windows 8.1, guess it’s time to migrate to Linux. It’s too easy to get overwhelmed, especially when building the foundations for future projects.

We’re supposed to set up a Venn diagram for our portfolio- Personal, Academic and Professional goals. It’s probably unhealthy that I couldn’t seem to separate mine, just a tangled web of what I want to do in the world.

I decided to set up a Scrum Board instead, mostly because it’s simpler to code. It also helps me break down and separate my goals. I can get a better idea of how my goals relate to each other and adapt them to get the most benefit out of each.
