  <div class="article">
    Projects breed projects. My laptop shell’s cracked, I should replace it. But I might bugger up the screen, I should set up its SSH. But my desktop runs Windows 8.1, guess it’s time to migrate to Linux. It’s too easy to get overwhelmed, especially when building the foundations for future projects.

We’re supposed to set up a Venn diagram for our portfolio- Personal, Academic and Professional goals. It’s probably unhealthy that I couldn’t seem to separate mine, just a tangled web of what I want to do in the world.

I decided to set up a Scrum Board instead, mostly because it’s simpler to code. It also helps me break down and separate my goals. I can get a better idea of how my goals relate to each other and adapt them to get the most benefit out of each.

  <div>Do Portfolio Work- I want to paint a picture of myself</div>
  <div>There are exercises to develop your portfolio spread through my uni course.</div>
  <div>I've decided to host my work here, anyone who comes to read my portfolio will hopefully check my other work.</div>
  <div></div>
  
  <div>19/01/25</div>
  <div>Write for myself- The words we write for ourselves are always better than those we write for others.</div>
  <div></div>
  <div>Nothing to do now but sit down and write</div>
  <div></div>
  
  <div>19/01/25</div>
  <div>Write pitches- Transforming one kind of paper into another would be nice</div>
  
  <div>
   I'm drawing opportunities from a variety of different sources.

   <ul>
<li>My friend who works in television flags opportunities to me</li>
<li>I'm an Open University Student and they send employment and apprenticeship newsletters</li>
<li>I'm subscribed to Sian Meades-Williams' weekly freelance newsletter</li>
<li>I live close to Cardiff, so I keep an eye on BBC Cymru for new opportunities</li>
   </ul>
  </div>
  
  <div>Once again, nothing to do now but write. I'm trying to build an address book of who was asking for what in the past- so I can predict what they might ask for later and who I might pitch origional ideas to.</div>
  <div></div>
  
  <div>19/01/25</div>
  <div>Get a university essay in a day early- It’ll be a good practice for setting my own deadlines</div>
  <div>I'm learning from journal entries of each essay I've handed in and my tutors comments to try and sharpen my skills</div>
  <div>I have two essays left on this course and a few courses left in my degree</div>
  <div></div>
  
  <div>19/01/25</div>
  <div>Get back in the gym- It’s one of the few things that clears my head</div>
  <div>I need to decide on the kind of skills I want to develop. I think a mix of calisthenics and running would be best.</div>
  <div>It's reasonably close to new years, Chinese New Year isn't until the 29th. Perfect time to get back in the gym.</div>
  <div></div>

  <div>Upload Old Essays- I have thousands of words of criminology and social science work from my previous courses. They’re not very good, but at least I wrote them</div>
  <div>I need to reread them to review the format. Should I rewrite them with my tutor’s comments?</div>

  <div>Migrate to a personal web server- A dynamic internet is a healthy internet</div>
  <div>I want it to be based on a single board computer, which server program should I to host on?</div>
  <div></div>
  <div></div>

  <div>19/01/25</div>
  <div>Comments- I need to give people a place to share their thoughts while keeping them on my site</div>
  <div>How could the UK Online Safety Act and other laws effect me? Are there any third party extentions I could employ to delegate the work</div>
  <div</div>
  <div></div>

  <div>Revamp tags</div>
  <div>They’re getting cluttered, I need clarity of purpose</div>

  <div>Web design- The site’s a bit plain at the moment and I think of it as a reflection of myself</div>
  <div>What's my favourite colour?</div>

  <div class="article">
   This has really helped me clear my head to see which projects are important to me and which I'm falling behind on. I've decided not to put a word count on this article in case I update it later.
