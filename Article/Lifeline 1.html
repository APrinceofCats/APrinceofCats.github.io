  <Article>
        <p>
      You’re scared. You’ve never been here before, never seen these people. You’ve been told, over and over, that they’re just there to help you. You even did some research yourself, their website leaves something to be desired… like information. They seem trustworthy, competent even.
        </p>

Just as you’re getting truly lost in your thoughts you hear someone call your name. You recognize the voice as the person you spoke to on the phone when you were first inquiring. You run through the same information for the fiftieth time, your address, your phone number, your star sign. Then just as you’ve confirmed you’ll actually be working with them you’re reminded that they won’t always be there to help you.

        <p>
In that vein you’re handed a sheet with some names and numbers you don’t recognize on it and asked to automatically trust them with your health. These supposedly lifesaving services are implemented on the same level as a dodgy takeaway menu.
        </p>
        
        <p>
I know that’s rich coming from a stranger on the Internet but please hear me out.
        </p>

        <p>
We’ve all heard of these services, most of us have probably used them, but how many of you really know them? Their histories, their methods, their intentions. I know this could  be seen as biting the hand that feeds us, but we need to accept they’re not always serving the best advice. We’re going to start this series with our own knights in shining armor, the Samaritans.
        </p>
        
        <p>
Long story short, someone thought they could make a difference, then actually tried to.
        </p>
        
        <p>
Going into more detail our story starts in London, 1953. The first seeds of change were planted by what they usually are, an almost certainly avoidable death. A girl was dead. Suicide. And watching over the funeral, his first service for the parish, was our man Chad. As far as ‘worst first days’ go...
        </p>

        <p>
This happened because there was no clear path, so Chad decided to forge one.  
        </p>
        
        <p>
Most of the advertising came from newspaper reporters who he knew from drawing children's comics, once again proving that the real key to changing the world is good networking and advertising. These days a Priest advertising himself to children would raise some serious questions, but the 50’s was a different time.
        </p>
        
        <p>
All the pieces were in place; one man with an office, an emergency phone and a steady supply of coffee. The seeds were starting to grow.
        </p>

        <p>
The first thing to grow was his team, because when you sit people who are already anxious together in a room to wait for who knows how long for them to talk about their problems and offer then coffee the first thing you want is some cooler heads in the mix.
        </p>
        
        <p>
An unintended side affect of this was people not feeling the need to talk to the man behind the desk. Surprisingly people looking to talk to a stranger about their problems didn’t care which stranger they opened up to.
        </p>
        
        <p>
And so it went, for more than 60 years. People would come in, pour their hearts out, then go about their day.
        </p>

        <p>
They spent that time growing their influence, and their reputation. But with a reputation comes expectations and sometimes they do more harm than good. Despite advertising themselves as people to talk to whenever the stress of life is getting to you people tended to assume it was strictly a place to talk about suicidal thoughts. Not unreasonable given it’s mental health charities handing out their number.
        </p>

        <p>
Even I didn’t call them no matter how many times I considered it. There’s still only a limited number of people manning the phones and you always convince yourself that someone else needs the time more. The problem with that thinking is there’s no such thing as ‘not bad enough’, it’s inevitable that you’ll only get worse until you do reach out for help.
        </p>
        
        <p>
Another problem with expectations is sometimes they’re wrong. Will they give you information, even if you ask? People on the internet with past experience seem to firmly say no, not even if you ask, but their website says the exact opposite. Their website states: ‘If you want specific advice, we may be able to give you contact details for organisations that specialise in helping with a problem you may have’. My first article and I’m already debunking fake news!
        </p>

        <p>
Their argument is that being able to talk to a non-judgemental person about your issues is the best place to start; I’ve heard people describe them as a brick wall that occasionally makes sympathetic noises. I’m not saying this approach is always a bad thing. The Mental Health sector needs to be ready to cater to anyone's needs and I always felt part of ‘getting better’ was being able to talk to my friends about my problems… and having friends. But when it comes to what I ask from mental health professionals, and people I ask for help in general, I feel that if I knew how to fix my problem I wouldn’t be talking to you about it.
        </p>
   
        <p>
When people come to you asking for help you suddenly need to be whatever they need; a friend, a leader, a lawyer, a philosopher, a historian, a politician. If someone reaches out to you hoping to be guided down the right path it can be their worst case scenario to  seemingly get nothing but some flowery language and the occasional ‘don’t give up!’ speech. It can feel like the guiding hand you were looking for has stuck two fingers up at you.
        </p>

        <p>
Am I suggesting it’s our fault for not researching properly? Maybe it is, I can hardly believe how much my perception of them has changed after looking into their basic history. I know it can be intimidating to check the facts yourself, especially when the internet is so full of pissed off former service users and charities talking about how much they can help you. But maybe if we show them they won’t automatically get our trust and respect, they’ll start trying to earn it. What I’m trying to do is encourage people to do this for themselves, to make them realize that questioning the people we’re expected to trust with our lives isn’t some radical act.
        </p>

        <p>
I hope I can earn your trust, on this strange path I’ve set myself on. If you’re interested in one more charming stranger insisting it’s all going to be okay, then I’ll see you next time.
