<u><h1 align = "center">Part One A: How Can You Employ Criminological Imagination and Inquiry in Daily Life?- 02/02/22</h1></u>

  <div class="article">
The theories of Criminological imagination and inquiry are comforting, everybody wants a True North guiding philosophy. So the question truly becomes, how do you apply criminological imagination to daily thinking?

You must look for opportunities to use your criminological imagination. I was wrapped up writing this very essay when I realised my grandparents were listening to a program about how medical negligence is handled in the UK versus Sweden and I spent the afternoon pondering “How does directly linking your healthcare system to the state affect how mistakes are handled?”

We must always remember to employ Criminological <b>imagination</b>. Criminological thinking can’t be dogmatic, and you can’t hold a criminological position for long simply because it’s in a text book. It is impossible to stick to your guns if the only reason you’re holding them now is ‘because’.

<u>Part One B: Can You Judge Political Graffiti as Ideological Advertisement?</u>
There are many adverts on the streets of Ireland; which product to buy? Which service to employ? Which political cause to support?

A good mural, and good political graffiti in general, is like an ad (especially when it’s government approved); How much footfall does that area see in a day? Is it memorable? Will people talk about it on social media? You couldn’t fit the story of Bobby Sands onto a wall without a very fine brush, but you can make people know her name, then you need to have faith in people that they’ll go and do their own research.

Many political groups believe in the same ideal ends, but differ in their methods. There should be a quiz challenging people to pair graffiti with the group who left them.
