  <div class="article">
When I once again sat down to plan out, I think, my fourth blog in the past ten years I felt I needed to establish a series out of the gate. I think perhaps this grew from my ideas of independence content creation being moulded by Youtube, it just happened that my medium was different. Declaring at the end of each post what my next would be, then hunching over my notebook on the school bus scratching together another top 10 list. I felt it was important to have a counter, each new hash a gold star proving I started and finished something. The best part about writing the first entry of a series, whatever it may be, is that you can fill time establishing the themes of the series alongside that individual instance.
