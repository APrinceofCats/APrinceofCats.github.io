  <div class="article">

There’s a first time for everything, including going to group therapy. Y’know, I’ll often start articles as bullet points I want to include in the final product then string them all together, but I thought it would be easier for people to prepare for their big day if I framed this like a checklist. Hooray for less work in the name of consumer convenience!

Most mental health charities could be mistaken for just another old building on the edge of town, and after so long that’s all they are to me. It’s hard trying to demystify something that became routine to you a long time ago, but I’ll do my best to remember that gut wrenching cocktail of anxiety and... more anxiety I felt the first time I walked through those doors.

<b>1) Check out their social media</b>
Obviously the best way to research a group is to… research the information the people running it put out, though of course their idealised view should be taken with a grain of salt.

I personally think Reddit and Discord are underused resources; on Reddit you can post anything from a few words to an article as long as this one, making it a good place for people to have room to better develop their arguments and experiences. On Discord messages are popping off every few seconds, there’s nothing like spur of the moment thinking to confront problems that could potentially have been developing your whole life.

<b>2) Groups Vs. 1:1 Support</b>
I’ve been to a lot of group sessions, a lot of one to one sessions, and a lot of impromptu family sessions at the top of the stairs at 3 AM. In that time I’ve learned two things. One, if you say ‘it’s all about finding that balance’ people will agree with you; and two, it’s all about finding that balance.

I think it’s fair to say I’ve been to ‘a lot’ of group sessions but I still only started going to them (at least willingly) late last year. I treated going to a group as a last resort, barely a step above medication, but eventually after raking over the same old ground in counselling and a few of those 3 AM conversations with a lot of reassurance and hugging I decided with all my experience I could at least try talking about my troubles to more than one person at once. Sometimes you need a roomful of people pooling ideas, resources and experience to face your problems.

<b>3) It lets you get a feel for the local help</b>
It’s pretty much expected that you’ll work with more than one charity, you have your own unique problems and it’s going to take a while to find the right people to help you. The same is true for the other people there including everything from addiction to housing.

Like I said, for all their breathing exercises and worksheets and motivational posters the best resource you’ll get out of a group is a shared experience of who’s operating in your local area, for better or for worse.

<b>4) It’s just sat round a table talking</b>
As frustrating as it is having to ask the question of ‘confidentiality’ for every word I write, I can’t exactly plaster pictures of actual groups wherever I like; so I went to the Internet to find some dramatic reconstructions.

<b>5) However well they hide it, everyone there is just as scared as you are</b>
I’ve been in The System since I was seven, literally for as long as I can remember. In that time I’ve been betrayed, disrespected,  and passed around so much I took to the internet to voice my frustrations, so much that doing that is the only job I can hope to hold down.

I can’t tell you exactly what your experience at any one group will be, but I can tell you that when you walk in to that room of 5, 10, 100 people: none of them want to be there, none of them know what’s wrong with them, and everyone is terrified that they might be a lost cause.

They’re not.

I know it’s easy to think that when you’re set adrift in the world, that you don’t deserve a second chance, that no one’ll care if you stay at home and suffer but I’m living proof to the contrary. Know that as long as you’re unsure about trying to get help there’s one stranger out there worrying if he could convince you to try it, and there’ll always be a place for you in that old building on the edge of town.

I’ll see you next session, tell ‘em Jonathan sent you.
