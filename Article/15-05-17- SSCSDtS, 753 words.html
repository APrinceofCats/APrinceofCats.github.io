  <div class="article">
On May 14th, 2018 Newport Mind marked the beginning of Mental Health Awareness Week by opening its doors to… the same people as usual plus their families. Therein lies the problem with advertising an event on your own social media: half the people who’ll see it already work for you, the other half work for them.

We did see a few new faces, and if the stigma they were trying to shut down was the idea that no one cared about us going under, they put that firmly to rest.

The first group I talked to was Meic, an ‘information, advocacy and advice service for children and young people’. Their funding comes from the Welsh Government, I’m not sure if that means they’d face more or fewer money problems than us. The main selling point, for me at least, was the number of ways you can get in contact with them; telephone, online chat, text message, chances are if you’re uncomfortable with one form of communication they have another ready you can work with.

The other group that showed up to help shine a light on our issues Rainbow Newport, doing their best to give us all a ‘one stop info station’ for people interested in the LGBTQQIP2SAA Community. The piece of paper they set up for people to write what they were proud of was simple yet… enlightening.

The event had all the markings of Newport Mind. Though the best markings the volunteers got was some stick-on labels with our names on, making it hard to work out who was in charge or ask for the information we were supposed to be giving. While it could get chaotic at times (this was in no way a ‘Safe Space’. Crowds + blenders + floor to ceiling windows = SENSORY OVERLOAD), the event was a thriving, electric gathering of people and organisations from all over Newport standing side by side to support a cause they believed in; which was awkward, since given the size of the room and how the tables were positioned two-abreast was enough to block anyone moving from one end to the other.

It wasn’t so bad given that most people stuck by the arts and crafts table, which was at the far end of the room from everything; I guess it came to a choice between leaving with a custom stress ball or leaflets that remind you to eat and sleep occasionally.

Maybe we should have used the leaflets for collages, they had a bold colour palette ranging from ‘Undercooked eggs’ yellow, ‘low black ink’ blue, and ‘consult a doctor’ purple (particularly relevant with the free smoothies we were handing out).

Some would say that the general, seemingly obvious nature of some of the information, eating fruit, going outside, talking to people, weren’t really helpful, but I think it shows how easily people overlooked the little things. I can’t exactly post the leaflets verbatim so you should definitely visit our website at <a href = "http://www.newportmind.org/" target = "_self">http://www.newportmind.org/</a> to find out more.

I’ve been rambling for a few hundred words now and you’re probably wondering ‘yes, but what was the point of it all?’ Well, if you are wondering why, I’m wondering why you’ve stuck with it this long.

It’s important to remember that the project has always been about providing two things: information and companionship.

We’re often broken into groups of 10 or 15, so as awkward as bringing as many people as possible into one room can be, it was a nice opportunity to link up with people from the project.

The problem with that is that it didn’t really help with getting more people involved with the project, yes we need to keep people within the project up to date with what we’re doing but that won’t help us fix the problem of our funding, we need more money than you can raise with a sponsored run or a whole swimming pool full of beans. We were trying to spread our information; information about how we’ve helped people, information about why we deserve to keep going, and if necessary information on who you can trust to help you if we’re not around anymore.

A good start might be moving the next open day out of our own front room, Mind (the adult service) is already going to have a stall in the flea market above the regular market. Until then, question everything, don’t get complacent, and if my subtle hint about spreading information wasn’t enough, please do share this with your friends.
