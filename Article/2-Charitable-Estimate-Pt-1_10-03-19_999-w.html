  What safeguards are in place to make sure only reputable charities get started?

Is there anything more human than a charity? People coming together with a common goal to form an organisation dedicated to helping people less fortunate than themselves, and people can still find ways to use them to spread hatred and greed.

But what safeguards are in place to make sure that doesn’t happen? Let’s find out.

From giving the backstory of a single charity to trying to research and explain just a small corner of the tangled mess of jurisdiction and regulations we’re ruled by within a two week timetable, I suppose there are worse character flaws than being too ambitious.

The Law is a game of definitions, these laws are no different. What’s a Charitable Purpose? When is something for the Public Benefit? Who shouldn’t have their hands on the purse strings?

I went into this trying to focus on laws protecting us rather than picking apart another organisation but ultimately it’s the Charities Commission for England and Wales that decides who gets the privileges. It always comes down to figuring out who has us by the balls this week, doesn’t it?

It comes down to Charitable Purpose and Public Benefit, basically how you’re trying to help and who you’re trying to help.

The charitable purpose can usually be found under the object clause of the Governing Document. Now being the heart, soul and brain of a charity their governing document is obviously available right on their website?… A dedicated database constantly updated by the Charity Commission?… The back of a serial box?... *sigh*, I’ll add it to the projects list.

There are 13 general descriptions of purposes, they are:
<ol>
<li>The prevention or relief of poverty</li>
<li>The advancement of education</li>
<li>The advancement of religion</li>
<li>The advancement of health or the saving of lives</li>
<li>The advancement of citizenship or community development</li>
<li>The advancement of the arts, culture, heritage or science</li>
<li>The advancement of amateur sport</li>
<li>The advancement of human rights, conflict resolution or reconciliation or the promotion of religious or racial harmony or equality and diversity</li>
<li>The advancement of environmental protection or improvement</li>
<li>The relief of those in need, by reason of youth, age, ill-health, disability, financial hardship or other disadvantage</li>
<li>The advancement of animal welfare</li>
<li>The promotion of the efficiency of the armed forces of the Crown, or of the efficiency of the police, fire and rescue services or ambulance services</li>
<li>Any other purposes currently recognised as charitable or which can be recognised as charitable by analogy to, or within the spirit of, purposes falling within (1) to (12) or any other purpose recognised as charitable under the law of England and Wales.</li>
</ol>
  
You can set out with more than one purpose, but they all have to count as charitable.  It’s like a funnel; start out with something as broad as a few words, end with something as specific as a book.

Okay, you know what you’re going to do, now it’s time to prove that it’ll actually help people.

“’Charity’ in its legal sense comprises four principal divisions: trusts for the relief of poverty; trusts for the advancement of education; trusts for the advancement of religion; and trusts for other purposes beneficial to the community, not falling under any of the preceding heads.”

Like ketchup to a tuna mayo sandwich it’s integral that every Charitable Purpose is for the Public Benefit.

There’s a big difference between what you say you’ll do and what you follow through on, so the Charity Commission is given a duty to “to promote awareness and understanding of the operation of the public benefit requirement”… I suddenly feel redundant. Oh well I’m used to it. Trying to get a political party in isn’t charitable for the same reason setting up a convent isn’t, you can’t scientifically prove that spreading a particular ideology would benefit the community.

Most of this is decided on a case by case basis meaning the laws around Public Benefit develop with every case, so brush up on those case studies.

It’s important to remember the idea of ‘Public Benefit’ isn’t a static concept. People will always want something, what they want and the best way to give it to them is going to change.

I feel the two main topics left to cover are how their money is actually handled and, something I always try to prioritise, what to do if you feel someone is acting out of line.

Most corruption has something to do with where the money is going and I think It’s be best to draw a clear line between the people using the charities and their assets, so because of that I’ll be splitting this piece into two parts; definitely not because my computer broke and I lost a few days work.

Please study the sources I used for yourself, I feel like I’m part of a bucket chain of watered down information.

I always worry my endings don’t have enough emotional punch to them but charities will (hopefully) always be part of our landscape, like a sprawling vista bathed in the light of sunset with vineyards and cottages populating the soft rise and fall of the landscape. Meaning when I run out of ideas and just trail off I can argue it’s all part of our amazing journey together. So… bye.
