<u><h1 align = "center">Endless Pressure- the Experience of the Hillsborough Families</h1></u>

<div class="article">
We all want justice. We all want to believe that if we just keep fighting long enough that the scales will tip in our favor. But sometimes, especially when facing off against the people who are expected to balance the scales, you may need a little outside help.

Private prosecution is the process of contesting the state’s ability to mount a proper prosecution against a defendant. This is usually because having the individual or organizations who are being scrutinized face consequences would be inconvenient for the state.

Perhaps the best known private prosecution within the UK is the one surrounding the Hillsborough disaster. Despite the initial disaster occurring in 1989 and the private prosecution beginning in 2000 the families of the victims kept fighting for another twenty years.
It seems that, lacking any kind of closure or definitive end to the event that a prosecution might bring, the people who survived the disaster are still emotionally trapped by it, feeling an ‘endless pressure’ from being denied justice. Another issue faced by the survivors in public perception was attempting to establish who was to blame. Many media outlets decided that the football fans didn’t deserve sympathy and therefore attempted to blame them for the disaster over the staff, with even the broadcaster for the match saying otherwise- “And I can only think that’s overcrowding. It doesn’t look to me to be any sort of misbehavior.” (The Open University, 2021)

Over that time, through sharing their stories of interacting with the Criminal Justice System and how it affected their lives and views of the world they gave the general public of the UK a glimpse into the processes of searching for justice and peace.With private prosecution, when you can unify behind a cause and keep the fight alive in the public consciousness, there’s no such thing as ‘over’.

‘Every time we have been knocked down we have been determined to come back stronger.’ Hillsborough Family Support Group chairwoman Margaret Aspinall, speaking outside Parr Hall in Warrington, June 2017 (Downes, 2021)

Governments, police forces, corporations; all of these entities are simply collections of individuals and if enough individuals gather together to oppose them they can match them in power. One thousand PC’s are equal in power to one government’s supercomputer, one thousand donations can be equal to one corporation's legal fund.
