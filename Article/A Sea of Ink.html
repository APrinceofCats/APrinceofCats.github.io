    I would love to fight a Japanese boxer. I'd also like to learn how to box which I think might take precedent. The clashing of a culture whit multiple established martial arts versus a culture with just the one. Two cultures clashing, the beauty fount in the vibrant colours of the contrast.
    <br><br>
But whose responsibility is it to put those colours to canvass? What work goes into connecting two cultures though a simple trail of ink?
    <br><br>
The localisation team, braver men and women than I, the most important thing trying to exercise control over one language has taught me is how little command I actually have over it.
    <br><br>
The average translator's salary is about £23,348 annual while the price of a plane ticket from Cardiff to Tokyo is about £1050.36, so they would have enough for a ticket over and maybe a Mars Bar for the way home.
    <br><br>
There are numerous stories of what working in the home-grown anime and manga industry can do to people, the long hours, sleeping at the office, the crushing expectation from all angles. So what systems are in place to keep the translators in good mental health? It's extremely hard to find any information on this topic, which is rather concerning. Hopefully in an age of mental health destigmatization and forcing corporate responsibility the general mental health resources will act as enough of a safety net.

I was often frustrated by the Jinxx banned Pokemon fiasco. People decided that something from a foreign culture was analogous with something from theirs and needed to be destroyed.

<img src="../Gallery-images/Jynx, Noh, Blackface.jpg" alt="" width="500px" height="250px" class="center">

Japanese Noh theatre has been a cultural stable for 300 years. Why not flip the script? Show the theatre as being inspired by the Pokemon instead of the other way around, create a fun but logical difference between the real and fictional world and pay their respects to another Japanese art form that was arguably a predecessor to modern animation.
    <br><br>
Japanese art got its chance to truly make its mark on Western culture in the 80’s and 90’s, with localisation companies like Central Park Media buying series and OVA’s by the crate load.
    <br><br>
A big positive of Japanese media is it has a much healthier balance between audience age ranges from children to very adult. Unfortunately this set them up for a trap with Western stereotypes of animation.
    <br><br>
The localisation companies went for quality over quantity of content and picked up the rights for any series going, mostly violence/torture porn from a company trying to recoup their losses. Then the buying public disregarded animation as being strictly for children, so now anime has a violent reputation it's yet to fully shake off.
    <br><br>
Is it even possible for something to be 'for' or 'not for' someone? I think of the time I performed one of my stand-up comedy sets at the local book club's open mic night  I talked about  planning my suicide, but framed it as someone writing the outline for a new book. I was confused the next day when mum came to me and said the audience had been lauding it as 'thought provoking'. I wasn't trying to be thought provoking, I was trying to be funny! How bad was I at writing if I couldn't even get my intention across?
    <br><br>
But then I realised, I only viewed it as a comedy because that's how I processed the experiences. I could find the humour in the repetition of thinking about killing myself because it was a repetitive train of thought for me, but from about three in four people's point of view they were being led down this old and well travelled track for the first time. As the first time I had talked to complete strangers about it, it was completely up to them to decide what they thought of the sightseeing. Like the birth and death of the author contained in one five minute skit.
    <br><br>
‘Adapting stories from a foreign culture’ doesn’t always mean a story being brought over here. ‘Manga Shakespeare’ is an incredible tool to bring generations together. My mum likes Shakespeare, I like manga, perfect synergy. I wonder how Shakespeare would react to this? His work, the most interpreted and reinterpreted in human history, still stirring emotion in the harts of all who read it through the visual lens of a far away culture, to see Othello taking to the skies of Venice on the wings of an angel.
    <br><br>
And isn’t that the entire point of art, storytelling, creation in all its forms? Giving people separated by oceans and years and languages a chance to sheer the stage of experience. May the whole world really is just a sea of ink.
