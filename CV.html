AIM Awards Food Drink and Cooking
Sep 2015 – Feb 2016
Lancaster and Morecambe College
Part of my college course focused on food preparation so I regularly worked in the kitchens helping to prepare food for school events and keep the facilities clean and in good working order.

Presenter
May 2016 – Jun 2016
Lancaster and Morecambe College
The college was holding a music festival in the auditorium to let the student bands get exposure. I was originally brought in to just play the crowd during the event, keep them distracted while one band left and the next set up, but, since I had to know the details of the setup I helped the organisers negotiate with bands who weren’t sure if they wanted to participate. I also helped working odd jobs, mostly manning the cake/merch stall outside.

Lancaster and Morecambe 34th Scout Troop
I was mostly responsible for keeping the hoard of 8 to 11 year olds somewhat in check while the other leaders set things up, though I was asked to plan activities sometimes. I was the only older boy on their team so I like to think they looked up to me (aside from in a literal sense).
